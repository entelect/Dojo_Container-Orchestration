# Kubernetes

Kubernetes requires a bit of a different configuration compared to docker Swarm
and as such it will not be able to use the docker-compose files, but instead will
use a Kubernetes configuration for deployments.

In addition this example will assume that you are using minikube to deploy and
run the examples. And if you are on Windows, via the Hyper-V driver.
